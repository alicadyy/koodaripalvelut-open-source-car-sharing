**In a [car-sharing co-operative](http://transitionus.org/sites/default/files/HowTo_StartACarSharingCoop_v1.0.pdf), members share a number of cars collectively instead of each owning a vehicle separately. Car-sharing allows non-car-owning members to forgo the large personal expense of owning and maintaining a private car. On the other hand, car owners can share the costs with the car-sharing community.**

Car co-ops have long been popular in some Western European countries, and have started to catch on in the U.S. and Canada in recent years. They can vary in size from a few friends sharing a car to tens of thousands of members sharing a large fleet of vehicles.

Our goal is to build a global network of millions of cars and billions of users. It can be done! As the word gets around, more and more people will see the benefits of not driving alone, especially when going to work. The positive emphasis on wallet and environment is obvious. And there is the possible plus of social networking as well!

Our working language is English since it is the obvious choice for a large-scale project such as this.

# Summary #

## Project vision and goals ##
  * [Open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) [Domain Model](http://domaindrivendesign.org/) for modelling Car Sharing
  * [Open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_movement) [SaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) platform for deploying a [Car Sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsharing) (also [peer-to-peer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_car_rental)) Network
  * Open-source platform that integrates between different Car Sharing Networks (think shared hotel booking services, flight ticket systems, etc.; buy-anywhere)
  * Collaboration network of service providers (insurances, car remote locking systems, car security systems, platform service integrators, platform SaaS service providers, automated billing systems, car maintenance providers, car pick-up/transfer/'valet' service providers, parking solutions, legal aid for tackling legistlative challenges, etc.)
  * All collaboration combined into one system, single-sign-on, open for everybody
  * Automated scheduling and handling of maintenance, cleaning, pick-up/transfer/'valet', door opening, tracking, feedback, etc.
  * Enable business opportunities: insurance companies, car remote locking systems, car security system providers, platform service integrators, platform SaaS service providers, automated billing service providers, car maintenance providers, car pick-up/transfer/'valet' service providers, parking service providers, legal services, etc.
  * To be extended to different forms of transportation: small airplanes, sailboats, motorboats, motorcycles, etc.
  * Aiming to be the most compatible, the most cross-collaborating and the most comprehenesive. To truly actualize concept of "sharing".

## Join us: Motivation - why join? ##
  1. fascinating because it is a complex domain modelling issue
  1. fascinating because it is a complex logistics issue
  1. fascinating because it can be enabled better by bringing together multiple fields of technology
  1. fascinating because it can effectuate an actual change in the way we transport ourselves
  1. love for cars and anything with an engine while trying to keep it environmental =)
  1. most private cars sit empty and unused on the street most of the time; car-sharing puts cars into better use! More value for the invested money.
